# SUV Purchase Prediction using KNN

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict whether a customer will purchase an SUV based on social network data. Using the `Social_Network_Ads` dataset, the model analyzes customer attributes such as age and estimated salary to predict buying behavior. This project provides insights into customer segmentation and targeted marketing using basic machine learning principles.

## Project Details

- **Objective**: Predict if a customer will purchase an SUV based on their social network profile.
- **Dataset**: Social_Network_Ads
- **Model**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Features Used**: Age, Estimated Salary
- **Target Variable**: Purchase Decision (Buy or Not Buy)

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Loaded and explored the data.
   - Cleaned and normalized features for improved model performance.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualized customer demographics and spending patterns.
   - Analyzed feature distributions to understand data trends.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Trained a KNN model to classify customers as potential SUV buyers.
   - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Assessed model accuracy using confusion matrix and classification report.
   - Analyzed the results to improve model performance.
